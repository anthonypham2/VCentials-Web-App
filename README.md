Deploying as a .jar

1.  Open up a terminal (Powershell or Command) and "cd" to your my-app directory within your code base.

2.  Run mvn clean package -Pproduction in the my-app directory (You need maven    for this)

3. Move the temprecorder-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file in tempRecorder2\my-app\target to your desired location
 

4. Open up a terminal in the directory containing the jar file and run the command java -jar temprecorder-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (Make sure you donâ€™t have any ports open on whatever port you set up the project to use in the application.properties file.) The app should be running at http://localhost:8080/login

 - Admin page needs to show and print out logging
 - When creating account, need to verify via email (or other)
 - Add a captcha for account creation
 - Apply a server host for the web app (Supports Java, such as an apache variety)
 - Added security for passing information, disabling development tools, etc
 - Color coding elements outside of nominal range for input temps (red=too hot, blue = too cold)
 - Protect Main Branch on Github
 - Change the database to a type that is persistent between runs, remains secure, and has as low of an install requirement as possible for the client and server.
 - Admin view needs to add the ability to change username, and clean up junk code left over from cloning Home page
